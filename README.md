# Mathematical-image-analysis
The page to store our attempt of JHU EN.553.493 final projects. Might be a little messy at the moment. 

## Function intended âš™: 
- watermark addition, simply with text
  - Potential improvement: Complex test, transparent test: Natural platform: Weibo, Xiaohongshu ;)
- watermark detection
  - Currently automatic
- watermark extraction
- watermark removal

## Catagories ðŸ¤”
Based on general review of image inpainting techniques, we are currently dealing with block distortion. We intend to try multiple inpainting technique to compare the result. Currently, there are
However, notice that this could be transfer to a text removal problem, and we are working on that.
