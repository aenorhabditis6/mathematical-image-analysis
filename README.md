# Mathematical Image Analysis

This repository stores our attempt at the JHU EN.553.493 final project. It may be a little messy at the moment.

## Functionality Overview ‚öôÔ∏è:

- **Watermark Addition**: Currently supports adding text watermarks. Potential improvements include handling complex text and transparency for platforms like Weibo and Xiaohongshu.
- **Watermark Detection**: Automatic detection of watermarks.
- **Watermark Extraction**: Capability to extract watermarks from images.
- **Watermark Removal**: Removes watermarks from images by impainting.

## Problem Statement
For inpaintng, we have following candidates: 
- **Patch-Based Methods**:
  - Ru≈æic and Pizurica: Used Markov random field (MRF) for well-matched patch search.
  - Jin and Ye: Employed annihilation property filter and low-rank structured matrix. Cited by 128. 
  - Kawai et al.: Selected target objects and limited search to the background for object removal.
  - TSLRA and gradient-based low rank approximation: Used for recovering corrupted blocks.
  - Xue et al.: Proposed depth image inpainting based on Low Gradient Regularization.
  - Liu et al.: Utilized statistical regularization and Markov random field for linear structure extraction.
  - Ding et al.: Used Nonlocal Texture Matching and Alpha-trimmed mean filter for inpainting.
  - Duan et al.: Developed an inpainting approach based on the Non-Local Mumford‚ÄìShah model (NL‚ÄìMS).
  - Fan and Zhang: Introduced an inpainting method using Sum of Squared Differences (SSD).
  - Jiang: Proposed a method for image compression by removing blocks.
  - Alilou and Yaghmaee: Used Singular value decomposition and approximation matrix for reconstruction.
  - Others: Utilized texture analysis, structure information, Saliency Map, Gray entropy, joint probability density matrix (JPDM), etc.

- **Diffusion-Based Methods**:
  - Li et al.: Employed diffusion for inpainting, focusing on localizing diffusion and constructing feature sets.
  - Sridevi et al.: Utilized Fractional-order derivative and Fourier transform for diffusion-based inpainting.

- **Other Approaches**:
  - Wali et al.: Proposed denoising and inpainting using total generalized variation (TGV).
  - Zhang et al.: Introduced example-based image inpainting based on color distribution.
  - Multiscale graph cuts technique: Used for inpainting images by analyzing various distortions.
  - Joint data-hiding and compression scheme using SMVQ and image inpainting.
  - Multiple pyramids method, local patch statistics, and geometric feature-based sparse representation for object removal.


## Dataset

The original dataset from Kaggle contains 50 images. We added the text-based watermark "EN.553.493" to these images at specific locations and change them to black and white.

Using gradient descent, we were able to recover the watermark from all 50 images:

After detection, our algorithm removes the entire rectangular watermark area:

## Categories ü§î
We are currently focusing on block distortion in image inpainting techniques. We intend to experiment with multiple inpainting techniques for comparison. Additionally, we are exploring text removal as a related problem.
